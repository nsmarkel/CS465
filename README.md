Architecture:
Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).

In the application we used a few different front end develpoment tools. Each of these had a strong point that we highlighted. Coding in HTML for the UI was much easier that trying to use JavaScript.

Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?

We used this so that we could store the data on the users machine. This allowed us to not need a server.

Functionality:
How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?

JSON is raw data that stores into databases. While Javascript is a programming language that can tell the machine what to do. We used JavaScript to display JSON

Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.

We tied the code to an API instead of just a giant database. This lessened the load on the users machine and allowed us to track errors easier. 

Testing:
Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.

Testing APIs with added layers of security involves verifying if the authentication, authorization, encryption, and other security measures are working correctly. This includes testing scenarios such as valid and invalid authentication, authorization for different user roles, secure transmission of data, and handling of error conditions.

Overall, testing APIs in a full stack application involves ensuring the proper functioning of methods and endpoints while addressing the complexities introduced by security measures to maintain the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of the system.

Reflection
How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?

I have been able to tie together the front and back end of a program to see how everything works together. Until now, I have only worked on one section at a time.
